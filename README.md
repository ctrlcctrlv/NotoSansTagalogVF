# Noto Sans Tagalog VF

This is a variable version of the font "Noto Sans Tagalog". It is the first variable *baybayin* font.

# What's done

1. All glyphs have been redrawn as open contours that can be stroked.
2. Glyphs that will be in Unicode 14.0 are added. (U+170D, U+171F)
3. Missing U+1734, also used in many *baybayin* texts, added.
4. Hollow kudlit added as stylistic alternates.

# What's not done

1. Not all glyphs cleanly interpolate yet, but this is easily fixed by adding more points to the bold.
2. The SFD files are precursors, UFO intermediaries need to be used for acceptance upstream.
